### Problems and Solutions
####  1. Unable to generate correct SQL Due to Lack of information
For example

```python
question = "Which courses are available in the Biomedical sciemce department for Spring 2025?"
sql = sql_generator.invoke({"question": question})
print(str(sql))
```
This code will retrun 
```sql
SELECT * FROM courses WHERE "Department" = 'Biomedical Science';
```
But the actual Department value is **Biomedical Science (BMS)**

#### Solution

Put needed information in to system prompt

```column_unique_values_str```is storing Needed Instructor, Department, Programs information
```python
{"Instructor": ["Michael Zhao", "Kevin Ren", "Qihu ...... or of Fine Arts)", "Dance (Master of Fine Arts)"]}
```

```python
system_prompt = """Your are an helpful assistence that helps answer questions about course on Spring Semeter of 2025. \
                All needed information is stored in course.db
                Here is a dictionary storing something values of the database. 
                The key of dictionary is Column name, and the value is a list of values of the database under the corresponding Column name
                
                Dictionary : \n
                """+column_unique_values_str[1:-2]
```
