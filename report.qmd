### Problems and Solutions
####  1. Unable to generate correct SQL Due to Lack of information
For example
s
```python
question = "Which courses are available in the Biomedical sciemce department for Spring 2025?"
sql = sql_generator.invoke({"question": question})
print(str(sql))
```
This code will retrun 
```sql
SELECT * FROM courses WHERE "Department" = 'Biomedical Science';
```
But the actual Department value is **Biomedical Science (BMS)**
